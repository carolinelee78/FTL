### Introduction 
The present study will use data from the [Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)](https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/cds/default.aspx) to explore unclear issues of FTL. The PSID is a is an ongoing longitudinal panel survey of American families, containing data that have been collected from the same families since 1968. We will use four of the PSID data sources. First, eight waves of self-report data document individuals who are transitioning into adulthood (Transition into Adulthood Supplement; TIAS). The wave includes individuals who turned 18 (and completed high school) who had families still active in PSID. Second, five waves of data document the same individuals' childhood (the PSID Child Development Supplement; CDS). The CDS includes reports by parents, other caregivers, teachers, and self-report. Forty-one waves of self- report data document the demographics and income dynamics of the individuals' families (the PSID Main Study; MS). Finally, a single wave of data that details the individuals' childhood as reported by them as adults (Childhood Retrospective Circumstances; CRCS).

### Introduction 

Not much is known about factors contributing to adult children being highly dependent on their parents and not transitioning to independent adult functioning (also known as 'failure to launch'; FTL). First, it is unclear which characteristics at childhood and adolescence contribute to this phenomenon later in life. One hypothesis is that individuals with FTL, compared with independent adult children (IAC), may have had more childhood and adolescence problems (e.g., individuals with FTL may have had low self-esteem in childhood). A second unclear issue pertains to the course of this condition as individuals get old. It is unclear why some individuals with FTL can overcome this condition while others do not. A third issue pertains to the families and parents of FTL children. That is, FTL is a condition that involves both the dependent child and the providing parent. However, not much is known about the parents of FTL children. For example, it is unclear what is the effect of family demographics and parents' psychosocial problems on individuals with FTL. For example, does a parent's absence or depression increase the chances a child will develop FTL.

The present study will use data from the [Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)](https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/cds/default.aspx)to explore unclear issues of FTL. The PSID is a is an ongoing longitudinal panel survey of American families, containing data that have been collected from the same families since 1968. We will use four of the PSID data sources. First, eight waves of self-report data document individuals who are transitioning into adulthood (Transition into Adulthood Supplement; TIAS). The wave includes individuals who turned 18 (and completed high school) who had families still active in PSID. Second, five waves of data document the same individuals' childhood (the PSID Child Development Supplement; CDS). The CDS includes reports by parents, other caregivers, teachers, and self-report. Forty-one waves of self- report data document the demographics and income dynamics of the individuals' families (the PSID Main Study; MS). Finally, a single wave of data that details the individuals' childhood as reported by them as adults (Childhood Retrospective Circumstances; CRCS).

The study has three goals. First, to examine which characteristics at childhood and adolescence are more prominent in individuals with FTL. Second, to examine the course of FTL dependency. Third, explore familial demographics and parental psychosocial problems that may increase the chances of individuals to develop FTL. Finally, in this protocol, we use the term "FTL" for brevity in place of "highly dependent adult children who are not functioning independently", but we use it without judgment and in a non-pejorative, descriptive way.
